Each file in the Chapter subdirectories contains the text of an 
example. The files are numbered so that the first code example in a 
chapter is 01, the second 02, etc. However, some shell commands that 
are in separate example blocks in the chapters have been combined into 
a single file. The file numbers do not necessary correspond to Listing
 numbers in the individual chapters. The files contain PHP programs, 
XML documents, SQL commands, php.ini entries, Smarty templates, and 
shell commands. Example
 files that contain PHP programs do not have PHP start or end tags
(<?php and ?>) except when the example itself switches in and out of 
PHP mode.
